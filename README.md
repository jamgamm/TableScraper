# TableScraper
Short practice for table scraping using python.
For this practice I scraped a table of NBA player of the week for the 2021-2022 season. 
The link to the site with the table can be found here: https://basketball.realgm.com/nba/awards/by-type/Player-Of-The-Week/30/2022
Then I took the scraped data and stored certain columns into an excel file (Season, Player, Conference, Date, Team).
The organized data can be found in the playerOfWeek.xlsx file.
